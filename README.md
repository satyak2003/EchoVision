## 🚀 The Problem
Digital Exclusion is a bottleneck. Millions of users with visual impairments, dyslexia, or motor disabilities struggle to navigate the modern web.

- Cost: Assistive tools (like JAWS) cost thousands of dollars.
- Complexity: Content is often too dense or complex to understand.
- Inaccessibility: Most websites lack basic accessibility features.

## 💡 The Solution
EchoLearn is a free, open-source Chrome Extension that acts as a "Digital Ramp" for the web. It combines Google Gemini AI with local browser APIs to transform any website into an accessible experience instantly.

## ✨ Key Features
🎙️ Voice Commander ("Jarvis for Web")
Hands-free navigation for users with motor impairments.
Wake Word: "Helper"
Commands: - "Helper open Facebook"
"Helper scroll down"

🧠 AI Simplification (Powered by Gemini 1.5)
Complex academic or news articles are instantly summarized into simple, easy-to-read bullet points for users with cognitive disabilities.
